principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest: "))
time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
print("Simple interest:", simple_interest)

10. Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci series up to n terms, where n is provided by the user.

n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

print("Fibonacci series up to", n, "terms:", fibonacci)

11. Write a Python program to check if a given number is prime or not.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num > 1:
    for i in range(2, int(num/2) + 1):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")

12. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given string

string = input("Enter a string: ")
